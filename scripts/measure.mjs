/* What the source cannot tell you about a page you have already built.
 *
 * The audit reads the files. The debug pass takes pictures. Neither answers the
 * three questions that actually decide whether a cinematic page is any good:
 *
 *   Does it move?     A parallax declared in the markup and a parallax that
 *                     happens on screen are different things. Three planes with
 *                     the same measured rate is a flat page with extra markup,
 *                     and it looks exactly like the real thing in a screenshot.
 *   Does it cost?     Sixty frames a second is the whole budget. A hero that
 *                     renders at 24 is not "cinematic", it is broken, and the
 *                     117 KB of animation library the page loaded and never
 *                     called is dead weight in the critical path.
 *   Does it read?     Fifteen distinct type sizes is not a typographic scale.
 *                     A 140-character measure is not a column. These are
 *                     computed values, so they can be counted rather than
 *                     argued about.
 *
 * Everything here runs in the page, against the render, and returns numbers.
 * The numbers are not the judgement - the screenshots are still the judgement -
 * but they catch the failures a screenshot cannot show, because a still frame
 * of a dead animation is indistinguishable from a still frame of a live one.
