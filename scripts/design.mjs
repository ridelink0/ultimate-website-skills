/* ultimate-website-skills/design - which Claude Design route is actually here?

   There is more than one, they are not interchangeable, and the wrong
   assumption is expensive. This plugin used to assume exactly one: that Claude
   Design arrives as an HTTP MCP server you register. On a current Claude Code
   build that is not how it arrives - the canvas is a BUILT-IN skill and the
   design-system push is a NATIVE tool, and running the old setup would have
   added a redundant user-scoped MCP server shadowing a capability the host
   already has.

   So this reports and never enrols. It reads the filesystem, and optionally
   asks the Claude CLI to list the MCP servers it already has (a read-only
   query), and prints what it found and what it could not see from out here.
   Registering a server, consenting, logging in and publishing all change the
   user's account or environment, and all of them are the user's to run. */
