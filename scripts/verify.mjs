/* ultimate-website-skills/verify - one command, one verdict.
   audit, debug/quality and security each print their own ad-hoc format with
   their own exit code, and "is this page done" today means running all three
   and reconciling them by hand. This runs them, folds every finding into one
   set of severities, and returns a single object a human or a script can act
   on without knowing the shape of any of the underlying checkers. */
