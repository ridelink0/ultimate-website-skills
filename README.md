Ultimate Website Skills 4.0.0 is the plugin formerly named cinematic-web-design (3.x), which in turn absorbed Atelier. [Migration and aliases](docs/merge.md) · [Claude Design setup](skills/ultimate-website-skills/references/claude-design.md)

# Ultimate Website Skills

**UWS for Claude.** Build, measure, debug and secure cinematic websites from Claude Code or Codex. Plugin id `ultimate-website-skills`; the old `cinematic-web-design` install name redirects on GitHub but the skill and commands now live under the new id.
A pinned art direction for websites, plus the code that produces it.

Coding agents converge on the same page: Inter everywhere, an indigo-to-pink
gradient, three feature cards with icon circles, everything centred, 16px radius
on everything, and copy about unleashing your potential. It is recognisable
enough that people have built scanners for it.

ultimate-website-skills replaces that default with a different one: editorial serif typography at
real optical sizes, warm-neutral and near-black grounds in OKLCH, cinematic
photography with eased scrims, layered scroll parallax, and exploded technical
views built from stacked 2D layers rather than a 3D engine.

**No more SVGs.** Hand-drawn vector silhouettes were how this plugin used to
fake depth, and they read as exactly that. Depth now comes from real WebGL and
real photography: an animated shader gradient, three parallax planes that blur
and haze with distance, and three.js for anything taken apart. SVG is kept for
what it is genuinely best at - line art, blueprints, icons - and nothing else.

It works in **Claude Code** and **Codex**.

## It wires itself

The scaffolder emits only the engines a page actually uses, so a page with no
3D never downloads three.js, and the audit checks it both ways: an engine's
markup with no script behind it is an error, and a script nothing uses is a
warning. `look` now captures console errors and uncaught exceptions too, so a
failed shader compile or a missing import fails the check instead of quietly
rendering less than it should.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridelink0/ultimate-website-skills
node ultimate-website-skills/scripts/install.mjs
```

That registers the plugin with both CLIs. Or do it by hand:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add ridelink0/ultimate-website-skills
claude plugin install ultimate-website-skills@ultimate-website-skills
```

```toml
# Codex - ~/.codex/config.toml
[marketplaces.ultimate-website-skills]
source_type = "git"
source = "https://github.com/ridelink0/ultimate-website-skills.git"

[plugins."ultimate-website-skills@ultimate-website-skills"]
enabled = true
```

## Use

Ask for a website. The skill triggers on its own:

> Build me a landing page for a roofing company in Houston

Or drive it directly:

```
/webdesign a microsite for the Old Bridge at Mostar
/webdesign audit ./my-site
```

## What is in it

**`skills/ultimate-website-skills/SKILL.md`** - the doctrine. Short, because the code carries the
design rather than the prose describing it.

**`assets/core.css`** - the chassis, copied into the project verbatim. Tokens,
reset, a fluid type scale computed to land exactly on its bounds, a 12-column
grid with breakout lines, nav, buttons, hero, dot-leader index, stats, glass
cards, frames, annotation callouts, the layered/exploded stack, spec table,
steps, accordion, form, marquee, grain, vignette, reveals, scroll progress.

**`assets/motion.js`** - dependency-free, one rAF loop for every scroll effect,
degrades to a fully visible page. `.r` reveals, `data-px` parallax, `data-tilt`
pointer parallax, `data-count` counters, `data-magnetic` buttons, `data-split`
per-word headline reveal, nav shrink, scroll progress.

**`assets/gradient.js`** - an animated WebGL mesh gradient. Layered simplex
noise with domain warping, mixed in linear space, dithered against banding,
paused off-screen, one static frame under reduced motion, CSS mesh fallback.

**`assets/depth.js`** - real three-plane parallax. A signed `data-depth` sets
each plane's rate against scroll AND pointer, and drives blur and haze from the
same number. Also single-photo 3D from a depth map.

**`assets/exploded.js`** - any made thing taken apart in three.js, reading its
layers from an `<ol>` so the semantic list is the no-JS fallback.

**`assets/sections.html`** - twenty-three section archetypes.

**`scripts/webdesign.mjs`** - the tool.

```
webdesign.mjs new <dir> [--preset bone|ink|cinema] [--name "X"] [--sections a,b,c]
webdesign.mjs sections                 list the library and the presets
webdesign.mjs add <id> [--to <file>]   insert one section
webdesign.mjs audit <dir>              source check: copy, semantics, the tells
webdesign.mjs look <dir|url>           RENDER it at two scroll positions: overlap, overflow, contrast, PNGs
webdesign.mjs cut <photo>              one photograph into parallax planes (rembg, local)
webdesign.mjs study --list editorial   render a batch of reference sites into contact sheets
webdesign.mjs serve <dir>              local preview
webdesign.mjs verify <dir|url>         one verdict: audit + render/quality + security, findings by severity
```

**`references/stack.md`** - which library for which job, with specifiers
verified against the registry and CDN URLs that resolve. anime.js v4 gets its
own section because every tutorial online is v3.

**`references/`** - typography, motion, imagery, composition, tells, and the
pre-ship checklist. Loaded only when needed, so they cost nothing the rest of the time.

## Looking, not just reading

`webdesign.mjs look` is the half that matters. It drives a real headless browser
over CDP - no dependencies, using Node's built-in fetch and WebSocket - loads
the page at 1440 and 390, and reports the bugs that only exist once something is
painted: **text overlapping text**, content past the viewport, contrast measured
against the background actually behind an element (including `oklch()` and
`color-mix()`, which every naive checker gets wrong), elements collapsed to zero,
images that failed to load, and tap targets under 24px. It writes a PNG at each
width so the agent can look at what it built.

Contrast has two paths. Where the background resolves to a solid colour, it is
checked in the page directly. Where it does not - a background image, or a
positioned layer painting underneath, which `bgOf()` correctly refuses to guess
at rather than produce a false failure - the screenshot the inspector already
captured is decoded and the actual pixels under the text are sampled: an
average across the box, and the darkest tenth of it, since a scrim eases from
clear to dark and a headline near the light end of that ease is the failure the
average alone would hide. A sample that spans a hard edge in the photo (part of
the box much lighter than the rest) is thrown out rather than turned into a
confident-sounding wrong answer. Every contrast finding says which method
produced it.

A layer covering half the composition passes every static check ever written.
This is how you catch it.

## The audit

`webdesign.mjs audit` is the part that keeps the output honest. It fails the build
on placeholder copy, emoji, missing `alt`, missing image dimensions, pure black
or white, undefined custom properties, absent `prefers-reduced-motion` handling,
duplicate ids, dead `href="#"` links, anchors pointing at ids that do not exist,
unlabelled form controls, more than one `<h1>`, skipped heading levels, and
`data-px` without `motion.js`. It warns on Instrument Serif, Playfair Display,
a missing grain layer, no negative letter-spacing, and no display line-height
under 1.

Zero Node dependencies. Node 18+. `cut` needs Python with `rembg[cpu]`.

## Why it looks the way it does

Three reference sites, reverse-engineered: a product launch page with a
photographic hero and a dot-leader contents block; a watch brand alternating bone
and near-black with a blueprint section and an exploded view; a city microsite
with a giant wordmark parallaxing behind a bridge. The common language is one
serif family carrying the page, tiny letterspaced labels, enormous negative
space, a single accent taken from the photography, and depth built from layers
rather than effects.

The specific numbers - `line-height: 0.92` on the hero, `-0.030em` tracking,
`max-width: 16ch`, grain at 0.055 multiply on bone and 0.13 overlay on ink, the
ten-stop eased scrim - are in the reference files with their reasoning.

MIT.

## Website debugger

Run node scripts/webdesign.mjs debug <site-directory-or-url> --out review to capture desktop/mobile, scrolling, interactions and reduced motion in an HTML gallery. Claude and Codex must open the PNGs before reporting a visual pass. See [visual debugging](skills/ultimate-website-skills/references/visual-debug.md) for action files and reference-video extraction.

## Measuring the page while it runs

A still frame of a dead animation and a still frame of a live one are the same
picture. So looking at screenshots, which is the other half of this, cannot
answer the questions that actually decide whether a cinematic page is any good.

```
node scripts/webdesign.mjs quality <site-directory-or-url>
node scripts/webdesign.mjs debug <dir> --measure     # folded into the debug pass
```

It measures four things against named budgets, in a real browser, on the
running page:

- **Does it move.** Frame timing over two seconds, and whether each canvas
  actually changes across them - a canvas can repaint sixty times a second and
  paint the same thing every time. Reduced motion is measured as a separate
  pass, because a page that keeps animating when the user asked it not to is a
  defect and it is invisible in a screenshot.
- **Is the depth real.** Parallax as a measured rate per plane: 1.00 is page
  speed, under it lags, over it leads. A correct three-plane hero reads
  something like `1.03 / 0.82 / 0.62`. Three planes that all read 1.00 are a
  flat page with extra markup, and only planes that actually declare a depth
  are held to it.
- **What it cost.** Bytes and requests, long tasks, layout shift - and what was
  loaded and never called. That last one is the expensive kind of dead code,
  because it sits in the critical path. It catches three.js loaded behind an
  import map, where checking for a global never would.
- **Does it read.** Distinct type sizes (a scale has a handful of steps; twenty
  is twenty decisions nobody made together), the largest size, the body measure
  in characters, and how many text colours are in play.

```
  ok    3 planes at 1.03 / 0.82 / 0.62 (1.00 is page speed)
  ok    1 canvas is animating
  warn  longest main-thread task 216 ms
           the page cannot respond during it
  warn  10 distinct type sizes
           a scale has a handful of steps: 80, 46, 29, 21, 20, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13
```

The budgets live in one place, `BUDGETS` in `scripts/measure.mjs`, stated as
numbers so they can be argued with. A report that says "feels slow" cannot be
checked; one that says "38 fps against a budget of 55" can.

Two honest notes. Headless Chrome is not locked to a display, so a frame-rate
figure is a ceiling rather than what anyone sees - the worst frame is the
useful half of that measurement. And the numbers are not the judgement: a page
can pass every budget and still look wrong, which is why this prints the path
to the screenshots and tells you to open them.

## Security check

```
node scripts/webdesign.mjs security <site-directory>
```

What the audit reads for taste, this reads for harm, offline, over the files
that would be deployed:

- **What must never ship** - `.env`, a `.git` directory (every secret ever
  committed becomes downloadable), source maps, key files.
- **Secrets** by their real shapes - AWS, Stripe live keys, GitHub, Slack,
  Netlify and Vercel tokens, private-key blocks, and the generic
  `api_key = "..."` assignment that catches the rest. A publishable Stripe key
  is public by design and is not flagged; a content hash is not a key.
- **Forms** - personal data over GET, an http action, a Netlify form without
  a honeypot, a page that collects an email and links no privacy policy.
- **CDN scripts** without `integrity` and `crossorigin`, and an import map
  without its `"integrity"` block (Chrome 127+, Firefox 138+, Safari 18.4+
  enforce it). Font CSS is generated per user agent and is exempt.
- **Headers** - the configuration in `netlify.toml`, `_headers` or
  `vercel.json` is source too; each missing baseline header is named. Every
  scaffolded site now ships with `frame-ancestors 'none'` enforced, HSTS,
  `nosniff`, a Referrer-Policy, a Permissions-Policy, and the full CSP in
  report-only so the import map keeps working until a nonce is added.
- **Client-side holes and disclosures** - `innerHTML` from a variable,
  `postMessage` to `*`, a `message` listener that never checks its origin,
  mixed content, inline handlers, `eval`, a developer's `C:\Users\<name>` in
  a shipped file, `console.log` left on, fonts served from Google (a visitor's
  IP goes to Google before the page paints; a German court ruled on it).

It exits 1 on a high finding only. A checker that fails a build over a
`console.log` is a checker people turn off. It also prints the three things
only the served site can answer - whether the headers actually arrive, and
whether `/.git/HEAD` and `/.env` are 404s - as curl commands to run after the
deploy. See `skills/ultimate-website-skills/references/security.md` for the
reasoning behind every rule.

## Verify - one command, one verdict

```
node scripts/webdesign.mjs verify <site-directory-or-url> [--json]
```

Finishing a page today means running audit, debug, quality and security
separately, each printing its own format with its own exit code, and
reconciling them by hand. `verify` runs the source check, one browser pass
that covers both rendering and the frame-rate/script-weight/type-scale
budgets, and the security scan, then folds every finding from all three into
one report grouped by severity - `error`, `warning`, `low`, `note` - with one
summary line and one exit code. A URL target has no source files, so the
audit and security sections are marked `skipped` instead of guessing at a
tree that was never given; the render/quality section still runs.

`--json` prints the same result as structured data (`{ target, sections,
totals, exitCode }`) instead of the formatted text, for a script that wants
to act on it rather than read it. The exit code is 1 exactly when any
underlying checker would already have exited 1 today - an audit error, a
render/quality `ERROR`, or a high-severity security finding - nothing here
makes anything newly fatal.
